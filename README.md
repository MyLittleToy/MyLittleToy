PhoneNow's call centre manager - Claire is seeking transparency and insight into the Call Center dataset.  This information will be used to facilitate further discussions with the management team. 

Objective: The purpose of this analysis is to create a dashboard in Power BI for the Call Center Manager that reflects all relevant Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and metrics:

Possible KPIs include (but not limited to):
- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

The dataset has been provided by Pwc Switzerland as linked here......> [01 Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx](https://github.com/MyLittleToy/MyLittleToy/files/12640566/01.Call-Center-Dataset.xlsx)

1. **Data Cleansing and Transformation**:
    - Cleaning and transforming data to ensure consistency and accuracy i.e. column type validation
    - Handling missing values and outliers when necessary.

3. **Data Modelling** 
    - No modelling was necessary as the dataset consisted od a singular table

4. **Data Visualisation** 
Utilising external tools such as Power BI to visualise my findings. I created two main dashboards to visualise the following:
- Agent performance KPIs: Number of calls answered/abandoned, Avg talk times, speed of answering, Avg satisfaction scores
- Call resolution stats: Resolved rate, calls by agent, cases resolved/not, and number of resolved cases v unresolved cases.

5. **Data Analysis** 

Agent related stats:
- Agent with highest average satisfaction score - Martha @ 3.47
- Agent who resolves the most cases - Jim, resolving 485 cases over the period
- Agent with most unresolved cases - Diane, with 181 unresolved cases.  It is imperative to note, however that Diane has a 71% resolved rate.

Resolution-related stats:
- Service with the most resolved cases - Streaming, with 73% of cases resolved
- Service with the most unresolved cases - Technical Support, with 28% of cases unresolved

Over-all stats:
- Average satisfaction score - 3.40
