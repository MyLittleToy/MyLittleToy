Feel free to explore the SQL projects that I've completed, links below:

**SQL**

**Project 1: Uplimit (formerly CoRise) SQL Crash Course Air BnB **
Included within this portfolio are solutions to the 8 case studies from the #8weekSQLChallenge by Data with Danny, spanning 8 weeks of intensive SQL challenges. These case studies serve as a testament to my proficiency in crafting SQL queries to address complex business questions. They reflect my dedication to honing my SQL skills and demonstrate my capability to extract valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

**Area of Analysis **
I utilised various types of SQL analysis techniques to answer different business questions within each of the two projects (week 1 and week 2) proposed by the team at Uplimit. Collectively, these approaches demonstrate my ability to approach a wide range of business questions and challenges using SQL. Breakdown as follows: 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Describing the data to gain an initial understanding of its characteristics.
   - Summarising data using aggregates like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

2. **Filtering and Data Selection**:
   - Using the WHERE clause to filter and select specific subsets of data that are relevant to each case study.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns using the ORDER BY clause.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - Grouping data using the GROUP BY clause to perform aggregate calculations within each group.
   - Calculating metrics like average revenue per customer, total sales by category, etc.

5. **Joining and Relational Analysis**:
   - Combining data from multiple tables using SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   - Analysing relationships between tables to answer questions that require data from multiple sources.

6. **Subqueries**:
   - Using subqueries to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts.
