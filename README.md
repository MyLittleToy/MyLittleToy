**SQL**

Project Link:	
Project Description: Included within this portfolio are solutions to the 8 case studies from the #8weekSQLChallenge by Danny Loves Data, spanning 8 weeks of intensive SQL challenges. These case studies serve as a testament to my proficiency in crafting SQL queries to address complex business questions. They reflect my dedication to honing my SQL skills and demonstrate my capability to extract valuable insights from data to drive informed decision-making.

Project Description: I undertook a SQL Crash Course with UpLimit (formerly CoRise) to supplement my SQL skills.  As part of this course I undertook two projects.  

**Area of Analysis **
I utilised various types of SQL analysis techniques to answer different business questions within each of my SQL projects. Collectively these approaches demonstrates my ability to approach a wide range of business questions and challenges using SQL. Breakdown as follows: 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Describing the data to gain an initial understanding of its characteristics.
   - Summarizing data using aggregates like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

2. **Filtering and Data Selection**:
   - Using the WHERE clause to filter and select specific subsets of data that are relevant to each case study.

3. **Sorting and Ranking**:
   - Sorting data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns using the ORDER BY clause.
   - Assigning rankings to data points based on criteria such as sales, performance, or ratings.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - Grouping data using the GROUP BY clause to perform aggregate calculations within each group.
   - Calculating metrics like average revenue per customer, total sales by category, etc.

5. **Time Series Analysis**:
   - Analysing data over time periods to identify trends, seasonality, or patterns.
   - Calculating metrics like monthly sales growth, year-over-year comparisons, etc.

6. **Joining and Relational Analysis**:
   - Combining data from multiple tables using SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   - Analysing relationships between tables to answer questions that require data from multiple sources.

7. **Subqueries**:
   - Using subqueries to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts.
  
8. **Window Functions**:
   - Employing window functions like ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), and DENSE_RANK() for tasks like calculating running totals or identifying top performers.

9. **Data Cleansing and Transformation**:
    - Cleaning and transforming data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
    - Handling missing values and outliers when necessary.

10. **Data Visualization** 
    - Utilising external tools such as Power BI to visualise my findings.
