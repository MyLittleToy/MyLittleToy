**Area of Analysis**
I utilised various types of SQL analysis techniques to answer different business questions within each of the two projects (week 1 and week 2) proposed by the team at Uplimit. Collectively, these approaches demonstrate my ability to approach a wide range of business questions and challenges using SQL. Breakdown as follows: 

1. **Descriptive Analysis**:
   - Describing the data to gain an initial understanding of its characteristics.
   - Summarising data using aggregates like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

2. **Filtering and Data Selection**:
   - Using the WHERE clause to filter and select specific subsets of data that are relevant to each case study.

3. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting data in ascending or descending order based on specific columns using the ORDER BY clause.

4. **Grouping and Aggregation**:
   - Grouping data using the GROUP BY clause to perform aggregate calculations within each group.
   - Calculating metrics like average revenue per customer, total sales by category, etc.

5. **Joining and Relational Analysis**:
   - Combining data from multiple tables using SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, etc.) to create a comprehensive dataset for analysis.
   - Analysing relationships between tables to answer questions that require data from multiple sources.

6. **Subqueries**:
   - Using subqueries to break down complex problems into simpler, more manageable parts.
